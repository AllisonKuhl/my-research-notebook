XML article - what is it and why should we care?

http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml

xml focuses on the _structure_ of the text, the semantic meaning of the text, just like old bob taught me in that online html class

spaces - makes language into a stream of words, not letters 
focuses thus on the _meaning_ instead of phonetics or letter sounds or whatever
deep.

xml is a hierarchy
well, in the same way html is a hiearchy
there is a <section> and then <p> within that as a branch, each has to close itself off. </p> </section>

descriptive mark-up, not presentational or procedural, focus on meaning and not what it will look like in the end or what it will do with the text (in that way, it is similar to html?)

schema
do you make up your own schema?
but the key is to use it consistantly in a standardized form

come up with schema before xmling document
do a document analysis then begin markup
why do you want to mark it up in the first place?
determine that first

ok neat.
