Humanities approaches to graphical display

what we SEE is not necessarily what things ARE

observation is not the same as the phenomena observed

phenomenal world vs noumenal world? 

Or the world we see vs the _world as it exists in reality_

But what is reality?!!!!!???!!!
can we ever truly know reality? 

And so we must make the distinction between what truly is (which we cannot know) and what we have _observed_ which is only one perspective of reality, a caught moment, a sense-datum, which could change in an instant, information which might have only been true in an instant, now gone,  and never more shalt be. 

I guess.

Capta - taken information. knowledge is constructed
Data - a given. you can record and observe it

is it possible to make graphs were lines are blurred, to show the constructiveness of data, to challenge the assumptions?

present "visual fuzzy logic"

subjective graphs!?

so deep
i literally cant even

is it a matter of persective or does space actually change? 

I guess its about the idea of "space"

that we construct ideas and attitudes about a certain space which gives it different nuances
