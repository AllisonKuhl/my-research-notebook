accessibility

To be honest I don't think too much of how other people will view what I produce, or think much about disibilities, mostly because I am so little affected by it in my everyday life. except for wearing glasses I guess, I'm more or less healthy, or "normal" whatever that means? Its fairly insular of me, perhaps, because I never think about these things. Part of it is because I don't make things for _other_ people, primarily, I make stuff for me. Or at least, that's what I say because if I say "I am making something for other people" I get too nervous, because what will they think about it? I'm too insecure to make stuff for other people. But you should think about other people.

My aunt is really into some acessibility stuff. She's always posting stuff on facebook, mostly about the deaf community, because she adopted two hearing impaired kids. I haven't seen them in like, _forever_, although the two kids were super endearing and fun to play with back in the day. I guess they're all grown up now. Ah, sweet childhood. How far away you are now!

But anyway... it's good to look at things from different points of view. perspectives, perspectives! Everything looks different from different perspectives.

a computer is different to everyone who uses it

all technology is innatural, there is no "normal way" to use it
all technology is assistive it is a tool for us to use
we can use it in different ways
but it is harder to use it for some things maybe?


hm, perhaps not suprisingly, this article is very easy to read. 
is it the font? Or how it highlights the text you are reading? Because that's very helpful.

universal design
sometimes accesibility concerns can help all people, or other people
