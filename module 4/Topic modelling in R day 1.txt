Topic modelling in R day 1

so moving on to the next exercise!

For today... I'm a bit lacking in energy
But at the very least, I'll download the stuff, and begin to work on the tutorial. 

oooh look i can earn badges. C: 

does not use = to asign variables but uses == for equal anyway hm but what do I know the = must be reserved for something else.

(hopefully I'm downloading it alright, my eyes kind of glazed over... did I hit the right buttons?)

do i download desktop or server edition? Since I don't know the difference I'll just do the first.

anyway back to the tutorial
It's pretty fun! :) 

plus i got a badge. c:

alright I finished the first 2 chapters of the tutorial and I think I will call it a day for now. 

more tomorrow!
