Topic modelling in R day 2

in unrelated news, I found my fountain pen again! 
many years ago, I had a dream. I was going to write and ink comics and make beautiful calligraphy and so on and so forth, so I bought some special ink (and it does not come cheap either) for this old fountain pen we had, which I had for about a day or two before I misplaced and it was gone! 
Gone! Vanished! I could not find it again! Just like all my dreams and hopes! 

but here it is again. And it took some fiddling, but it is working again and I have two more packs of ink before it runs out. 

But anyway, school. 

So I thought I'd do R because who doesn't like learning new programming languages? 

But first of all, what is R? 

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf 

It's a different implentation of S! Ha, like that helps! 

anyway, skimming over the tutorials...
but whatever the best way to learn is to do!

lol copy and pasted first part: result - 
error error 
error 
package rJava could not be loaded

well i won't let this get me down.
I'll try something different later but I need to work on some other stuff now so I'll be back.
