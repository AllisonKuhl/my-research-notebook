exercise 1 the dream case 

Allison here, reporting back on module 2, exercise 1: the Dream Case. 

the epigraphic database was interesting
unfortunately my latin isn't really that good
I took it in first year but its been a while

so I tried searching by occupation
I searched "poeta" and there were only a few entries. I downloaded the spreadsheet and saved it in a new folder

I also searched "Agricola" which seemed mostly to return people named Agricola and not farmers, and "figlin*" as suggested
figlin returned lots of "ex figlinis" which means what, out of bricks? i dunno.

I also searched for my last name in the war graves thing but there were only 2 kuhls who died. I suppose that's a good thing. I don't recognize the names anyway.
