outwit hub

so i downloaded outwit hub
and plugged in the data. It wasn't that hard so that's nice. 

at first, I didn't understand what was going on with this information
because what is the Suda? What is an Adler number? 
I was very confused
I'm still not sure I get it
Why did we search for pie? 

so the specifics of this search I am not entirely clear on

but I understand that it shows you the adler number, which I think is where the text is located in the adler adition of the Suda (Ada Adler, who was the mother of Neil Bohr, the atom guy! Wow! It's a small world.)
Ada's a nice name. Maybe that's what I'll call my firstborn daughter. Or Theodora? 

so it shows you where the text is located and the translation. 
I guess that's useful?

I think I need to look into this more to understand it better.

in the meantime ONWARDS AND UPWARDS
