             <p>blies," in order to their being "a happy people," who will " fully appreciate the value of their superior condition." Vol. i. p. 388. - <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">He</person> then expresses him-self in terms almost approaching to rapture, when speaking of the conditions of the Negroes in the <placename key="Caribbean" ref="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=15_21_4_N_71_56_7_W">West Indies</place>; nay, <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">he</person> even doubts whether the abolition of the Slave-trade was not a great evil, inasmuch as it prevented the removal of Africans from a state of barbarism and misery, in their own land, to that state of civilisation and improvement, a West Indian plantation ! (Vol. i. p. 371. ii. p. 332, &c. &c.)</p>
             <p>One of the blessings attending this removal <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">he</person> rather amusingly discovers to be, that <interp key="I feel like I should say not true" n="Dr. Williamson" cert="high" ref="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/349/990/304.gif">"indolent, good-for-nothing Negroes," (and it seems there are many of these in <placename key="Jamaica" ref="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Jamaica&params=17_59_N_76_48_W_type:country">Jamaica</place>,) who, " if they were left to their own free wills, uncontrolled by <i>wholesome laws</i>, which encourage industrious habits, would become idlers and plunderers, and return to barbarism," (vol.i p. 345.) here find the control of <i>such wholesome laws</i>. In other words, their indolence finds a cure, and their industry an incentive, <i>in the wholesome discipline of the cart-whip.</i></interp> In short, whenever <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">Dr. W.</person> speaks in <i>general</i> terms, he seems at a loss of words strong enough in which to eulogise the humanity and tenderness of West India proprietors and overseers. But let us come to particulars, in order to see how far his facts tend to contradict or to corroborate his panegyric; and, that this may be better understood, we shall range our extracts from his work under the same general heads which we adopted in the case of <persname key="Cooper, Thomas" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="priest">Mr. Cooper's</person> information.</p>
			 <p><i> State of Morals and Religion</i></p>
			 <p>"The manner in which Sunday is spent," observes <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">Dr. W.</person>, " will appear extraordinary and very contradictory to the duties inculcated on that day. A great market is kept by the Negroes, which is, in truth, also a market for the Whites. The merchants attend at their stores and counting-houses." (Vol i. p. 42.)</p>
			 <p><interp key="well I think it depends on a lot of different factors" n="Dr. Williamson" cert="unknown">" The sacred observance of Sunday appears to me," <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">he</person> says, " necessary, if we expect any good effect from the commands of God. In countries where the duties of that day are becomingly attended to, a greater proportion of virtue, &c. is to be observed. On the contrary, where the Sabbath is violated, the manners of the mass of the people are vicious, regardless of every commendable principle, and afford examples of human de-pravity which, it is with reluctance I must say, is too applicable to <placename key="Jamaica" ref="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Jamaica&params=17_59_N_76_48_W_type:country">that country (Jamaica)</place>.</interp> It is much to be wished, that the fourth commandment were more fully taken into consideration. It seems <i>possible</i> to do away <i>Sunday markets</i>, and <i>cultivating the ground. Sugar-mills should not be at work on that day,</i> indeed, no labour allowed. <interp key="Well I mean, that's the old testament law. At least in my churches theology we would argue that that doesn't necessarily apply because in Christ the law has been completed. That is not to say we shouldn't go to church but that it's okay to work on the sabbath." n="Dr. Williamson" cert="high" ref="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-27.htm">It was appointed, by Divine authority, to be a day of rest and devotion, in which no work should be performed." (Vol. i. p. 108.)</interp></p>
			 <p>" It must be admited," <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">he</person> goes on to remark, " that the means of religious instruction to Negroes, in <placename key="Jamaica" ref="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Jamaica&params=17_59_N_76_48_W_type:country">Jamaica</place>, are yet extremely defective ; and, it is still more painful to add, that the White inhabitants are culpably inattentive to public religious duties. It were well if that were all. <i>Contempt for religion is openly avowed by a great proportion of those to be met with in that country." </i> (Vol. i. p. 328.)</p>
			 <p>" The propriety of matrimony," <persname key="Williamson, John" from="18th century" to="19th century" role="M.D.">he</person> tells us, " is seldom impressed on the minds of the Negroes, by the clergy or any other White persons. Indeed, the latter, themselves, shew the example of a libidinous course of life, and follow that promiscuous intercourse which can scarcely be justified in savages." (Vol. i. p. 329.)</p>
			 <p><interp key="Could be true I guess." n="Dr. Williamson" cert="unknown">" At our parish-church, the people of Colour behaved themselves with the greatest propriety, but the White persons conducted themselves with great indecency." </interp>--</p>
