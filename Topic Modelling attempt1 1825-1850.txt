Topic Modelling attempt1 1825-1850

So I just did a prelimary run of the document through the topic modelling tool. 

Here's what I got

1. de es la le ou pages en se du ca

2. mr bill read house act time ordered committee day order

3. tie te bc ed ad lie st er lis tlie

4. report referred committee petition bill address excellency house council presented

5. john petition st district road praying county james township william

6. province majesty canada year government general governor act made law

7. il ii ti li ut iii ai tu flic ille 

8. te ta cf ail lie tise god bis ho ai

9. church people bis great bas man men state country religion 

10. land river north miles st. part side island country water

So what does this tell us? It seems a major theme of most of these documents have to do with government and is legal things, especially 2, 5, and 6. 

Another big topic seems to be nonsense words. In 1, I think it's mainly french stop words which its not ignoring because it's a different language. Looking briefly at the file I noticed a bunch of the stuff was in French. But the tool can't really distinguish that maybe. Other nonsense words I really don't know. I think it's just messy text. How do I clean it up? I tried using open refine earlier but it was really slow, so I'll try again later. 

9 is the most excplicitly religious. Yet it doesn't talk about God as such, but mostly churches and people and the state. 

10 is mostly geographical terms. 

So what does that tell us? I will have to think about it.
