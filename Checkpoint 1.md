###Primary Data: 
I hope it is okay to use that enormous file downloaded off Canadiana.org. That is not too boring or unoriginal? 

So for those who don't know: I am talking about an enormously massive [webscrape](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fsufmu60zysd6fq/lutheranoutput.txt?dl=0) of all the documents from a simple search of "Lutheran" in [Canadiana](http://search.canadiana.ca/search?q=Lutheran&field=&df=&dt=).It's so big it keeps freezing my computer every time I try and open it. :( I'll post it in my repo anyways.

###Collection method: 
Used api download from [module 2](https://github.com/hist3907b-winter2015/module2-findingdata/blob/master/m2-exercises.md).

I have been recording some of my progress, mostly my personal thought process, on my blog [here](http://2kuhl4u.wordpress.com/). I plan to post more information there on the future on my project. I'll probably end up posting a lot about my struggles in life, not that anyone cares about that. But it is a necessary part of my work process so I guess it's ending up there. On the blog though I will be posting more marginal articles and not necessarily the actual work. I'll be posting summaries, maybe some stuff on Lutheranism in general, fun related stuff and so forth there. 

My actual notes and work and progress I guess I will try to post in the repo. I will try to be more diligent and take better notes!


###Secondary Readings: 
Last term, I did an essay on [Lutheranism in Canada](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8avqgmizjdjvwt/Canadian%20Culture%20essay.docx?dl=0), so I can probably re-use that bibliography. Haha I'm so embarrased to link to that though. It's laaaame. XD Or at least it could be better, I kind of ran out of pages to do it justice...  But I think while writing that essay I exhausted most of the secondary sources avaliable. At least, readily avaliable. There's not a _whole_ lot that I could find in the Carleton library, but I was pleasantly suprised to see us mentioned in a few books on the church in Canada. 
Of particular note, I have a book on the history of the Missouri Synod which my uncle gave me (Zion on the Missisipi, by Walter Forster) as well as a book on the LCMS in Ontario which I borrowed from St. Paul's downtown and still haven't given back.... (Grace and Blessings, by Malinsky). There's a book on the ELCIC at the Carleton library but it's a bit dated. 

There was another good book that I saw at St. Paul's a while back called "What's going on among the Lutherans", but last time I checked there I couldn't find it there again. But it was a very nice and clear exposition of the history of the various synods in north america and the doctrinal controversy there. As that is actually super confusing, this is a very useful book! It's also full of exciting theological debates and dramatic splits over minor theological issues! Anyway.... I am also suscribed to various Lutheran magazines which sometimes has informative articles. The various synod websites also offer good information, if that counts as a source. Their history section is generally pretty short but they have lots of doctrinal statements issued from across the years. 

###Initial thoughts on what you might find/explore/puzzle over:

In a way, I am not expecting to find much. I just can't possibly begin to imagine people talking about Lutherans outside the Lutheran church outside of marginal references It's probably just like, ads from newspapers advertising that there is a Lutheran church service on Sunday. Why else would anyone be talking about Lutherans? Honestly I look at that mass of text and become overwhelmed because I just don't understand anything about it. I hope, however, to find out! It is my goal to try and begin to understand just what it is I am looking at, what this long seemingly nonsensical string of whatever actually is. 

I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do with it. Some kind of textual analysis? What I would like to learn is just what kind of sources are being here, why they are mentioning Lutherans, in what contexts, and in what manner? I think this can even have a practical application if I learn why Lutherans are being talked about and in what manner because obviously the goal is to be talked about because they want to convert people. These days everyone is freaking out because attendance is decreasing. In what ways has the church engaged the public in the past? How can we do that again? But then again, I'm not sure if this will give me the answers. I really have no idea what kind of information I can get out of this. I suppose it will be interesting to see.
