What is this website?

http://www.recoveredhistories.org/

slavery. 
pamphlets and supplementary texts
campaigning
many different voices
seems to attempt to capture different sides but obviously against slavery because who isn't?
nobody likes slavery.
purpose: enlighten people about slavery I guess
slavery's the worst

gives the documents with narrative interpretation
even has cute little quizzes to make sure you've got it straight
informative for the lay reader I suppose
very textbook


abolitionists as the heroes, pro-slavery the ones propogating viscous ideas that have ruined African history forever
however 
I have heard that anti-slavery also propogated a 
somewhat racist protrayal of blacks
in that they were somebody who needed white help. 
and so it continues today. 

documents obviously selected somehow
couldn't find where they got these documents or how or why they chose these particular documents

but whatever
I trust that they were good intentioned
as we all are
