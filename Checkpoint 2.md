I will be using some kind of text analysis on my stuff. I'd like to run it through the topic model thing to get a general sense of some of the themes within the text, then run a more detailed analysis using Antconc or Voyant or something. 

I will split it into different dates, and, if I can get my act together, I would like to maybe pull some more searches on other denominations from Canadiana in order to compare with what I already have. What are the differences and why? And so forth.
