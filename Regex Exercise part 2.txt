Regex Exercise part 2

Okay it's been a while since I've worked on this but I must. 
reading week is nearly over.

so to recap. 

i have deleted most of the extraneous text, but there is still blank spaces. I need to figure out how to delete this and then fix up the lines which still have a ~ in front of them. 

so I did something and it worked.

^[^~]

So similar to what the instructions had before, it deletes all beginnings of line that do not start with ~. 
how ^ is different than \n I do not know. \n does not seem to do much on my browser.

 Welp, whatever works I guess.

Onwards!

okay. now to find the year and then delete any extraneous numbers at the end of each line. a year has four numbers, so we can specifically look for that. 

[0-9]{4}

and we want to delete the comma and the numbers after it. 

so thus, group the different sections, keep what the group you want, have away with the rest.

so I thought I could do \2 for replace to just get the second group but it mysteriously does not work

it's because I forgot to include a space in the 2 group so it ended up all squished together with the day. 

i like regex actually. 
it's pretty fun

anyway moving along.

i will guess what I have to do next without looking. 

get rid of the "to", n'est pas?

I'll try it on my own.

so what I need to do is get rid of the space in front of to and add a comma. 

at first it didn't work, but it did when I put them in parentheses

oh well the next step was actually to remove the tilde but whatever 

I don't gotta play by your rules!! SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!

so I'll remove the tilde now. I don't think any tildes will show up elsewhere so I'll just put in ~ and replace with nothing

and bang.

okay final task, I will do it by the book.
delete all the additional commas
