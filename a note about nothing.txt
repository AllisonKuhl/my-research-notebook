a note about nothing

i don't know if I can do this

there's like, a mental impasse blocking me. 
I can't start anything. 
I have so many projects
but I just
cant 
start 

because if I start, it won't be good enough
that's the probelm
aaaggghhh 
my life is falling apart
but what does any of it matter anyways?!
