rasperry pi

this is not relevent to the course.
But I need to tell the world!
Rejoice, o mortals!
Yesterday I found out that the library
does not only have an excellent collection of books
but also rasberry pis and arduino boards!

So impulsively,
I immediately 
went downstairs and got a rasberry pi.
I thought it was the coolest thing ever!

So now I have a rasberry pi

....what am I supposed to do with it?!
