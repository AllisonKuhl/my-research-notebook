big data for dead people - actual note

big data for dead people - actual note

a thought that came to me - 
sometimes you don't want to see the process of something
ex. politics and sausages
(or is that cowardly?)

anyhoo. i will continue, but I will write this note just as I normally write notes

do computers offer new ways to deal with historical data or does it treat all history as a nail?

-linguistical analysists
-seems to me this is entering the realm of applied linguistic studies
-used to illustrate themes and trends over time

-words from historical fiction versus how often word actually used
"actually" like as in books from the period I guess

-word analysis too obvious? -we are pretty attuned to words -documents we analysise after all only offer one perspective

-data from english trials
-offers lot of information
-"speech acts" of criminal -how they thought and talked compared to other contemporary documents

digital history - helping to put documents into context among many similar documents 
or something i dunno
see wider trends

positivism - what is it?
are we only asking these questions because the computer gives us easy answers?

there are limits to textual analysis
we need to find new ways?
