information visualization - creating space

http://www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=469

interesting to remember... 

some visualizations are of things that exist, ex. model of atom

but here we are dealing with the visualization of something non-visual, abstract, that is... how to describe it? data. information.

these are given spatial meaning where space did not necessarily exist
