wget

http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html

‘-B URL’
‘--base=URL’
Resolves relative links using URL as the point of reference, when reading links from an HTML file specified via the ‘-i’/‘--input-file’ option (together with ‘--force-html’, or when the input file was fetched remotely from a server describing it as HTML). This is equivalent to the presence of a BASE tag in the HTML input file, with URL as the value for the href attribute.

For instance, if you specify ‘http://foo/bar/a.html’ for URL, and Wget reads ‘../baz/b.html’ from the input file, it would be resolved to ‘http://foo/baz/b.html’.

Interesting, interesting.

I don't get it.
