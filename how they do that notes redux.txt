how they do that notes redux

okay this time I will pay better attention to that actually how they did that part. 

holocaust thing
-excerpts 
-the idea of choosing and forming a narrative
organized by individual, tells a personal story
scalar. what is it? i missed it

african american travel journals
-go through many memoirs, autobiographies, etc. 
of famous people only
avaliable on web, images on web
put into an excel file, 
put in name, location, date etc. 
viewshare - has nice map program apparantly

kindred britain
mysql database or something weird like that
i've always wanted to learn that
one man's vision (formed initial database)

welp, I think I understood the video a bit better this time. 
I was concious this time. 

anyway it's very interesting, yes.
it has given me much to think about when looking at dataprojects
i will not take them for granted
I will think on it more.
