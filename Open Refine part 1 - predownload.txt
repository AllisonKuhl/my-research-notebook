watching the movies on the website
because we're supposed to apparantly.

aw man. 
it's interesting and simple
but like, this video is making me fall asleep because im so tired....

goodnight world.

it is now the next day. 

I will continue watching the videos.

things to remember from the videos:
video 1
can cluster themes thematically
try and match together things which mean the same thing
can be different even if an extra space is added
eliminate these differences!
standerdize the data  .... standardize 

video 2
can easily seperate rows and clean up data
use things like ** to indicate what you want

video 3
fancy json stuff wat
url fetching feature
can pull info from other websites to add columns

google refine: it's preetty amazing.
