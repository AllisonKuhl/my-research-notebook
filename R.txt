R

x <- assigns variables
help(functionname) describes function
c(1,2,3) combines items into vector
vector - I think it's like an array or list or that kind of thing
barplot(vector) makes a bar plot
can name vector values
names(vector) <- c("name1", "name2")
*note* indices start at 1 (weird)






P. S. What's a pirates favourite letter?

You'd think it'd be R, but it's actually the C. 
HAHAHAhahaha.
