update feb 13th 

I will work on stuff soon. I am a bit behind in this course. I will catch up. I must work hard! 

But for now... i need a break. I will start as soon as I can. Saturday? Sunday? Monday? (that's my birthday) 

but now that it's reading week I must work harder. Now that there is more time I must do my best! Don't give in! Fight the good fight! Never surrender! Discipline yourself! Work hard and serve God! 

yes okay I will start working now.
