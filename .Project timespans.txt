.Project timespans

So I'm currently downloading stuff from Canadiana

the search was for "lutheran" up to the year 1900

Should I make the time period smaller? It's taking like forever to download. 

Maybe in 50 degree intervals? So up to 1850 first? I am assuming there wouldn't be a lot of stuff in the years before that, like, the 18th century. Maybe there is? I should check.

Something to think about

Actually I think I will do it by decade. 

even if that's too small I can add stuff together

...it's still taking a long time to download though... my computer's so slow. :P

so i figured out what was wrong with it. 
I think it was downloading all the stuff from previous downloads too which is why it went on and on and on and on. 

but I deleted the old ones and started a new one so it should be quicker now. :)

Right now I'm doing it in 25 year intervals. I feel that's a bit arbitrary? But 10 years you hardly get anything.

up to 1850 there will be repeats, but from then i searched 1851 to avoid repeats

I feel like there must be a quicker way to go through each time period instead of manually changing it? 

Like a loop or something? but I don't know this programming language.
