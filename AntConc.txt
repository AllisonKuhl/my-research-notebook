I wonder why is it called AntConc?

Anyway corpus linguistics brings me way back to my first year when I took applied linguistics and we talked about it, ah, what warm nostalgic memories, it makes me feel young and happy
again

so downloading antconc now

meanwhile, as it's downloading

but really what do ants have to do with anything? And why are we conking them?

ok right I should start this now

antconc - uses txt files unicode(UTF-8)

seems the most difficult part of this is coming up with what to search for

there's a lot of connect-the-dot analysis you have to do on your own

I'll think about it
