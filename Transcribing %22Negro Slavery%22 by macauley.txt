Transcribing "Negro Slavery" by macauley

the name is vaguely familiar. Where did I hear from this guy before? was he in India or something? 

whatever. 

ok.

So I picked a page and random and I don't really know what's going on but whatever I'm transcribing it.

(at first I thought we had to take a half-hour break after transcribing to rest our eyes and I'm like cool, finally a break
but turns out its only 30 seconds. so I better keep working. lol) 
never give up! Onwards and upwards! For the glory of God!

minor questions - 
things I am wondering but feel are too trivial to bother people with. 
(i'll have to search it up on google later maybe)

Things that are in italics - I've been putting it in <i> tags. Originally I thought maybe use <em> because that's how they do italics in html5, but I thought <i> would be more semantically correct. Because it's not for emphasis it's actually italics because the text itself is in italics. I think that's the correct use. 

<UPDATE> I looked at that TEI handout we got linked to. 
It says to do italics like so. <hi rend= "italic"> italics here </hi>
that seems like a lot of unnecessary words tho. Why not just use <i>? its best to be concise. </UPDATE>

there is a number at one point. Should I enclose it in <li> tags? It also seems to be a header... but like, <h6> maybe. I dunno. It's not much of a list. I just put it in a paragraph tag. whatever.

Also when there is a line break that divides a word I've been including the hyphen but I wonder if that's necesary. 
Anyway I'm halfway done so back to work. 

done transcribing.

which reminds me

I put for the page number the page of the file and not the actual book. Hope that's right.
